## Simple Card Interface

I want to build a card-game of some kind using Bevy. This is where I'll be experimenting with the interface.

### Goal(s)

1. Drag a rectangle around and leave it where dropped
2. Drag a rectangle and snap to different slots, returning to initial slot if not dropped on another
3. Initialize a stack of cards and drag them around, pushing and popping from each slot
4. Be able to flip cards
5. Define rules and states for each slot 
  - enabled, disabled (can't place), flip on place, stagger placement
6. More probably...
